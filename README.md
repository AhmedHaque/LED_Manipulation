# LED_Manipulation
## Overview
In this project, we use a potentiometer to control an RGB LED. We use the RGB LED on the Tiva TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller and the potentiometer on the EduBase V2 board. We use the Analog-to-Digital-Converter (ADC) on the Tiva to read the change in value of the potentiometer and change the Red, Green, and Blue values of the RGB LED using Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM). The program was written in Arm Assembly.
